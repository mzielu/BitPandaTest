Answers for questions below

## 1. Let us know about some Apps that are currently out on the market, where you think they did a good job in development and justify your choice.

### Answer
The first thing that comes to mind is the Revolut app. They did a good job in terms of UX, interesting UI, smooth animation. I like the new design with the bottom navigation. The most impressive are the charts and the way they are presented on the screen, I also appreciate that their latest version of the app supports Lolipop devices (most projects only support marshmallow devices) which can cause some difficulties. Of course, I have to mention that not everything is perfect (for example the offline performance is disappointing).

## 2. How would you handle this situation? The Product Owner comes over to you and asks for an implementation with which he can see the performance of his crypto wallet over the past weeks. He is an iOS user and doesn't know the Android

### Answer
If possible, at the beginning I propose a meeting among the Product Owner, iOS developer, and myself in order to determine the details of a given feature in terms of the possibility of implementation on various mobile systems. If such a meeting is not possible at the moment, I analyze potential problems and discrepancies that may occur between platforms and what aspects of the proposed implementation are causing difficulties on the Android platform. In addition, I try to explain to the Product Owner the recommended Android conventions and make him/her aware that they differ on both platforms. In addition, I inform the Product Owner that without consulting the iOS team, we should not approve the implementation (assuming that mobile applications should work in the same way).

## 3. What kind of (technical) projects do you work on in your spare time?


### Answer
For the past year, I have been perfecting my own application "Kraków pod ręką" showing the location of city trams, buses and car rentals in Krakow. This is an app that I created while studying as a term project and recently rewritten it for Kotlin. It was a good opportunity for me to test some Android tools and libraries that I hadn't used before.
Recently, in January, I started working on an application for the amateur basketball league in Krakow, in which I play actively. I started with creating a very simple REST API (data already downloaded from the website, database is all set up). In the near future, I will start developing mobile applications (I will probably do it in Flutter to create on both platforms, it would be helpful for me to get familair with Android Jetpack Compose, where UI building is very similar). This is a private, free project that I am currently working on.
