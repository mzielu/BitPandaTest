# TASK 1
First task for the BitPanda Android recruitment process

### TODO

1. Show a list of Currency Wallets (Icon, Symbol, balance). As you can see there is a lot of code reuse, 
try to improve it Cryptocoin and Metal are considered as Asset, Fiat and Asset are considered as Currency. 
Each Currency has a Wallet, and you can have multiple Wallets per Currency. 
- For Metals show the name in the list eg.: "Gold" 
- Do not show deleted wallets
- Data should only be retrieved from the Repository

2. Sort the list by type : fiat, cryptocoins, metals and the balance of the wallet
3. Add a functionality to filter Currencies by type (a simple button which rotates the type is enough)
4. If you click on an entry open a simple DetailView where you show the price of the coin
- Use precision to format the price with correct amount of decimal places
- Prices are euro prices

5. Test your implementation with Unit Tests
